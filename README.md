# The_Drawing
There's a geometrical drawing on the cover of "Architectural Graphics", 2nd ed, 1985, by Frank Ching.   This is 'C' code to reproduce the figure by generating HPGL2.  HPGL2 is the graphics language understand by old LaserJets, like the LaserJet 4.

HPGL2 was also in high-end inkjets produced by HP in Rancho Bernardo in the mid 90's.   Almost all the remaining output I have is from those machines.
